From Text File:

line 1 # max. number of iterations
line 2 # number of patients in input file (COVID-19 patient locations; 4 initially infected (initial cluster centroids), 96 who contracted the virus from those 4, for a total of 100)
line 3 # total number of clusters (k, the number of initially infected patients)
next lines are indices of initially infected patients.
83,13 # point of the form x,y.  Patient X, y coordinates
